Never be bored related to fulfillment of life.

Wife is best word to define your value as a friend and confidant, and I will do my best to never
take that for granted. I promise to help you get the most out of life.  I will always provide that for you through challenge, support, and mostly laughter .  I promise to be your stoneill be your rock, and for lack of a better word your galactica. 
And of course, I will always love you.
